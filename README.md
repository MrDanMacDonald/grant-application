An app for submitting grant applications to a foundation.

Users can setup profiles, upload documents, and create and submit grant applications.

Administrators can view, make comments, and assign statuses to the grant applications.

This project was a collaboration with fellow Lighthouse Labs student Stefan Krahn.
